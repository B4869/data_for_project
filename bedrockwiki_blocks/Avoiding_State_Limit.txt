# Avoiding State Limit

## Introduction ​
Blocks have a limit of 16 valid values per state that cannot be exceed. This guide will explain how to avoid reaching the limit.

* TIP
This tutorial does not show you how to have more than 16 states values, however using this method will simulate that!

## How It Works ​
This method combines two or more states in order to re-use and read them in permutations or conditions. 
For example, a block with the English alphabet letters will need 26 values. You can use less values by using combinations.

## The Logic ​
What your code will do going of by the example above is the following:

    1 & 1 = A   1 & 5 = E   1 & 9 =  I   1 & 13 = M
    1 & 2 = B   1 & 6 = F   1 & 10 = J
    1 & 3 = C   1 & 7 = G   1 & 11 = K
    1 & 4 = D   1 & 8 = H   1 & 12 = L

And then;

    2 & 1 = N   2 & 5 = R   2 & 9 =  V   2 & 13 = Z
    2 & 2 = O   2 & 6 = S   2 & 10 = W
    2 & 3 = P   2 & 7 = T   2 & 11 = X
    2 & 4 = Q   2 & 8 = U   2 & 12 = Y

Using this method, you achieve the same results with just 15 values. The more values available for combinations, the higher your state limit is.

## How It Looks ​
Using the example above as reference, your states would look like this:

- Example above as reference 1
    minecraft:block > description

        "states": {
        "wiki:value": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13],
        "wiki:division": [1, 2]
        }

And for your conditions, like this:

- Example conditions as reference 2
    "condition": "q.block_state('wiki:division') == 1 && q.block_state('wiki:value') == 1"

- Example conditions as reference 3
    "condition": "q.block_state('wiki:division') == 1 && q.block_state('wiki:value') == 2"

## What You Have Learned ​
You have learned how to use less than 64 states and do more, combining states to have better possibilities.

* TIP
You can use more than 2 values in order to have more possible combinations.
