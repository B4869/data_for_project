# Troubleshooting Blocks

 * TIP
 This page contains troubleshooting information about blocks. You should read our global troubleshooting document before continuing here.

## 0.0 - Trouble ​
"I followed a tutorial or tried to make my own block and something's wrong! "No need to panic! This page will help debug common issues.

## 1.0 - Texture Troubleshooting ​
Fix issues related to block textures.

## 1.1 - Texture is Black and Magenta 
I will be reviewing three different types of blocks that have different layouts: Dirt-like , Log-like , Grass-likeNavigate to your RP/textures/terrain_texture.json. Ensure that the file is properly named.

- Example 1 Texture 
    RP/textures/terrain_texture.json

        {
            "texture_name": "atlas.terrain",
            "resource_pack_name": "wiki",
            "padding": 8,
            "num_mip_levels": 4,
            "texture_data": {
                "wiki:dirt_like": {
                    "textures": "textures/blocks/dirt_like" // You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
                },
                "wiki:custom_log_top": {
                    "textures": "textures/blocks/custom_log_top" // You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
                },
                "wiki:custom_log_side": {
                    "textures": "textures/blocks/custom_log_side" // You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
                },
                "wiki:custom_grass_top": {
                    "textures": "textures/blocks/custom_grass_top" // You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
                },
                "wiki:custom_grass_bottom": {
                    "textures": "textures/blocks/custom_grass_bottom" // You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
                },
                "wiki:custom_grass_side": {
                    "textures": "textures/blocks/custom_grass_side" // You can replace this with anything, just remember the name
                }
            }
        }

Next, navigate to your block file. In your block file, make sure you have the material_instances component.

Dirt like block example:

- Example 2 Texture 
    BP/blocks/dirt_like.json

        {
            "format_version": "1.21.60",
            "minecraft:block": {
                "description": {
                    "identifier": "wiki:dirt_like"
                },
                "components": {
                    "minecraft:material_instances": {
                        "*": {
                            "texture": "wiki:dirt_like"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

Log like block example:

- Example 3 Texture 
    BP/blocks/custom_log.json
        {
            "format_version": "1.21.60",
            "minecraft:block": {
                "description": {
                    "identifier": "wiki:custom_log"
                },
                "components": {
                    "minecraft:material_instances": {
                        "*": {
                            "texture": "wiki:custom_log_side"
                        },
                        "end": {
                            "texture": "wiki:custom_log_top"
                        },
                        "up": "end",
                        "down": "end"
                    }
                }
            }
        }

Grass-like block example:

- Example 4 Texture 
    BP/blocks/custom_grass.json

        {
            "format_version": "1.21.60",
            "minecraft:block": {
                "description": {
                    "identifier": "wiki:custom_grass"
                },
                "components": {
                    "minecraft:material_instances": {
                        "*": {
                            "texture": "wiki:custom_grass_side"
                        },
                        "up": {
                            "texture": "wiki:custom_grass_top"
                        },
                        "down": {
                            "texture": "wiki:custom_grass_bottom"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

If you followed this properly, your block should now have correct texture.

## 1.2 - Texture Displays "?" on Dirt ​
Problem: My custom block has turned into a dirt block with a question mark on it.This an unknown block, which appears when the block identifier is changed or if your block JSON invalid.Solution: Use a JSON linter and double check that your identifier didn't change. Ensure that you block has minecraft:geometry and minecraft:material_instances, or an RP/blocks.json textures entry.

## 2.0 - Rendering Troubleshooting ​
This section will describe common block rendering issues and how to fix them.

## 2.1 - Transparency isn't Working ​
Problem: You have transparent pixels in your texture file, but when applied in-game, they become opaque.Solution: Navigate to your block file. Navigate to your material_instances component. Add the following to your component:

- Example Transparency 
    BP/blocks/your_block.json

        {
        "format_version": "1.21.60",
        "minecraft:block": {
            ...
            "components": {
            "minecraft:material_instances": {
                "*": {
                "render_method": "alpha_test"
                }
            }
            }
        }
        }

## 2.2 - Block Creates Shadows ​
Problem: You have block with custom geometry but it has a shadow.Solution: Add following component to your block's code:

- Example Block Creates Shadows 
    minecraft:block > components
    
        "minecraft:light_dampening": 0

## 3.0 - Common Content Log Errors 
This section will describe common content log errors and how to debug them.

## 3.1 - Collision/Selection Box Errors 
Problem: You get a content error similar to:
[Blocks][error]-minecraft:collision_box: min can't be below (-8, 0, -8) and max can't be more than (8, 16, 8)

Solution: Check your minecraft:collision_box or minecraft:selection_box components and do the following:
- Make sure the X and Z values are in the range -8 - 8.
- Make sure the Y value is in the range 0 - 16.
- Make sure the box doesn't exit the block's 16×16×16 unit a

## 3.2 - Model Errors ​
Problem: You get a content error similar to:
geometry.your_block contains X boxes outside...

Solution: Your geometry is bigger than Minecraft blocks allow. You can either make the geometry smaller or split it into multiple blocks.
