The name of the structure. The identifier must include a namespace. For structures created via the /structure command or structure blocks, this namespace defaults to "mystructure".

Type: string

- size
read-only size: Vector3;

The dimensions of the structure. For example, a single block structure will have a size of {x:1, y:1, z:1}

Type: Vector3

* Notes:
 - This property can throw errors when used.
 - Throws InvalidStructureError

## Methods

- getBlockPermutation
getBlockPermutation(location: Vector3): BlockPermutation | undefined

Returns a BlockPermutation representing the block contained within the Structure at the given location.

    - Parameters

        - location: Vector3

        The block location relative to the Structure's origin.

    Returns BlockPermutation | undefined - Returns a BlockPermutation. Returns undefined if a block does not exist at the given location.

* Notes:
 - This function can throw errors.
    - Throws @minecraft/common.InvalidArgumentError, InvalidStructureError

- getIsWaterlogged
getIsWaterlogged(location: Vector3): boolean

Returns whether the block at the given location is waterlogged.

    - Parameters

        - location: Vector3
        
        The block location relative to the Structure's origin.

    Returns boolean - Returns whether the block at the given location is waterlogged. Returns false if a block does not exist at the given location.

Sets a BlockPermutation within a Structure.

    - Parameters
        
        - location: Vector3

        The block location relative to the Structure's origin.

        - blockPermutation?: BlockPermutation = null

        The BlockPermutation to set.

        - waterlogged?: boolean = false
