EASY
Adding loot tables to containers in structure is easy, you need to have a PC and your choice of either NBT Studio (executable) or Loot Tabler (browser application).

## Setup
    
    - Creating the Loot Table
    To start, create the directory BP/loot_tables/chests and create your loot table file here.

    You can learn how to make loot tables in Beginner's Guide

    - Example
    BP/loot_tables/chests/my_structure_loot.json

    {
        "pools": [
            {
                "rolls": {
                    "min": 8,
                    "max": 10
                },
                "entries": [
                    {
                        "type": "item",
                        "name": "minecraft:glass_bottle",
                        "functions": [
                            {
                                "function": "set_count",
                                "count": {
                                    "min": 4,
                                    "max": 6
                                }
                            }
                        ],
                        "weight": 1
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "item",
                        "name": "minecraft:potion",
                        "functions": [
                            {
                                "function": "set_count",
                                "count": {
                                    "min": 4,
                                    "max": 6
                                }
                            }
                        ],
                        "weight": 1
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

    - Exporting Structure
    Once you have created your loot table, export your structure into BP/structures. Then follow the steps for either NBT Studio or Loot Tabler

## NBT Studio (Executable)

    - Software Preparation
    Download and launch NBT Studio

    - Adding the Loot Table
    Launch NBT Studio and open file (Ctrl + O)

    Find your container (Ctrl + F)

    Navigate to your container, block_position_data > block_entity_data. Add a string tag

    Add LootTable and the file path to your loot table

    Save changes (Ctrl + S)

## Loot Tabler (Browser Application)

* TIP
To export a structure on mobile devices, Download this pack.

    - Adding the Loot Table
    Open the website and click "Upload". Choose your structure file.

    Find your container in the containers list, making use of the information displayed under "Container Options"

    Under "Loot Table", enter the path to your loot table. Set "Loot Table Seed" to blank or 0 if you want the loot to generate randomly. If you want the loot table to generate consistently, enter a specific value.

    Download your structure file and place it in BP/structures.

## Testing
Load your structure and open the container
