# Vanilla Materials

* WARNING
Materials are not for the faint of heart. Be prepared for potential crashes, content log errors, and long loading times.

Materials are extremely useful for making entities more unique. You can make new ones for your add-ons, or use pre-existing vanilla materials.

You can learn more about creating materials here.

## Properties

Materials can have a range of different properties which affect their appearance, including:

    - Backface-Culling
    This makes the inside faces of models not render.

    - Alpha Channel
    Enables analogue translucency, usage of the alpha channel of textures.

    - Emissive
    Causes the texture to not be affected by dim lighting, and appear to glow. If there is usage of the alpha channel, the emissivity is in direct proportion to how transparent each individual pixel is.

    - Set Translucency
    Regardless of other properties, is always completely rendered at a pre-determined translucency.

    - Texture Blending
    When multiple textures are present, may use a filter of sorts to change the entities appearance, based on the textures.

## Details on the Materials

The following is a last of each material, along with general known properties. The names are vague pointers to what each will do, some may act rather unpredictably, or have undocumented usages, so this only is what's certain for each:

* WARNING
The following section has currently only been tested for with single textures. Take it all with a pinch of salt. It is highly recommended to experiment with the materials yourself.

    - alpha_block
        - Backface-culling
        - Completely Opaque

    - alpha_block_color
        - Backface-Culling
        - Translucencies as Transparent

    - banner
    Inconsistently renders objects with transparency behind.
        - N/A

    - banner_pole
