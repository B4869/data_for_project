#TypeScript

TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript. As TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, existing JavaScript programs are also valid TypeScript programs.

Typescript is very beneficial to use when developing scripts for Minecraft add-ons. There exist libraries to aid in the development of Minecraft add-ons to provide intellisense and type-safety for broadcasting and listening to events.

#How it Works ​

TypeScript is a language which requires compilation into JavaScript. Minecraft has no idea what to do with a .ts file. Therefore some tooling needs to be set up in order to utilize TypeScript to build add-ons.

First, the TypeScript files need to be compiled into JavaScript, which is all accomplished by utilizing the TypeScript Compiler. Then the files can be utilized by Minecraft's scripting system.

Since there is already a build step, we might as well incorporate some other systems to allow for file separation and code sharing. Minecraft's scripting system will only act on the script files within their respective folders utilizing what is assumed to be, Mojang's own JavaScript interpreter. Therefore, any logic split across multiple files must be merged into a single large file. This is where tooling such as webpack and browserify come in handy.

##Script API 
​
##Prerequisites ​
    Minecraft Bedrock Edition (Windows 10)
    A code editor like Visual Studio Code (although Notepad will technically be sufficient, we will be assuming the usage of VSCode going forward)
    basic knowledge of Javascript (this tutorial will not be teaching you how to code in Javascript and presumes a baseline knowledge of it)
    Node.js is required for installing tooling and compiling TypeScript into JavaScript.
    Knowledge of TypeScript

##Setup Guide ​
This guide is for setting up a Script API TypeScript project using TypeScript compiler.

    -Getting Started ​

    Open a terminal (Command Prompt for Windows) and navigate to where the project should be located. It can be anywhere. For Windows 10 you can also Shift + RClick in file explorer and select Open in PowerShell.

    If you haven't already. Run cd to set the directory the terminal is running on to the directory the project is located in.
        
        - Example
            cd path/to/project

    Next we need to install the TypeScript for creating the add-on. To do this, enter the following commands.

    The following command install TypeScript globally.

        - Example
            npm install -g typescript

    The following command creates a package.json file in current directory.

        - Example
            npm init -y

    The following commands install Script API modules. Beta APIs is used in this example.

        - Example
            npm install @minecraft/server@beta
            npm install @minecraft/server-ui@beta
            npm install @minecraft/server-gametest@beta
            npm install @minecraft/server-admin@beta
            npm install @minecraft/server-net@beta

    Now your folder structure should include the following directories:

    node_modules
    package-lock.json
    package.json    

    *TIP

        If you receive an error such as command npm not found, ensure you have Node.js installed and added to the PATH.

    Now the project can be initialized. The next step is to create a TypeScript project by creating a tsconfig.json file in your current directory, with the following details which simulates the Minecraft Scripting API file system.

    - Example
        tsconfig.json

            {
            "compilerOptions": {
                "module": "ES2020",
                "target": "ES2021",
                "moduleResolution": "Node",
                "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
                "baseUrl": "./src",
                "rootDir": "./src",
                "outDir": "./scripts"
            },
            "exclude": [ "node_modules" ],
            "include": [ "src" ]
            }

    Now that you created the project, it can be opened in your IDE of choice. If you are utilizing VS Code, you can cd into your project directory and run code . to open your project.

    -Project Structure ​

    node_modules
    src/
    ├── Main.ts
    manifest.json
    pack_icon.png
    package-lock.json
    package.json
    tsconfig.json

    Unless you know what you are doing, the only part of the project to be concerned with is everything within the src folder. That is where all the development should take place.

    -Writing scripts ​

    Now write your first TypeScript code in src directory, for example below:

    - Example
        BP/src/Main.ts

            import { Player, EntityQueryOptions, GameMode, Vector3, world } from '@minecraft/server';

            // Example function that uses the provided types
            function findPlayersInSurvivalMode(location: Vector3): Player[] {
            const options: EntityQueryOptions = {
                gameMode: GameMode.survival,
                location: location,
            };

            const players: Player[] = world.getPlayers(options);
            return players;
            }

            // Example usage
            const playerLocation: Vector3 = { x: 10, y: 20, z: 30 };
            const playersInSurvivalMode: Player[] = findPlayersInSurvivalMode(playerLocation);
            console.log(playersInSurvivalMode);

    -Commands ​
    The following commands are most utilized when developing a project.

    - Example
        tsc

    tsc will compile all your TS files in scripts folder to your behavior packs folder.

    - Example
        tsc --watch

    --watch will watch for any changes you make within the src directory and automatically reinstall the add-on.

    node_modules
    scripts/
    ├── Main.js
    src/
    ├── Main.ts
    manifest.json
    pack_icon.png
    package-lock.json
    package.json
    tsconfig.json

    Now the src/Main.ts file should have been transpiled to scripts/Main.js with the following code:

    - Example
        BP/scripts/Main.js

            import { GameMode, world } from '@minecraft/server';
            // Example function that uses the provided types
            function findPlayersInSurvivalMode(location) {
                const options = {
                    gameMode: GameMode.survival,
                    location: location,
                };
                const players = world.getPlayers(options);
                return players;
            }
            // Example usage
            const playerLocation = { x: 10, y: 20, z: 30 };
            const playersInSurvivalMode = findPlayersInSurvivalMode(playerLocation);
            console.log(playersInSurvivalMode);

    -Packaging ​

    To run the code in Minecraft, zip the behavior pack and import it to a Minecraft world. In your behavior pack should only include these files in the following, and the rest of the files do not have to be included in .mcpack compressed file.

    scripts/
    ├── Main.js
    manifest.json
    pack_icon.png

    Congratulations, you have created your first TypeScript project for Script API.
