# Introduction

## What Are Add-Ons? 
An "Add-On" is the Minecraft Bedrock Edition (Windows 10, iOS, Android, Consoles) equivalent to Java mods. In contrast to Java however, the Bedrock Edition API is officially maintained by Mojang instead of the community. In general, you can think of mods as modifying the game, and add-ons as adding onto the game, following the development opportunities provided by Microsoft.

 * TIP
 PAlthough we're very pleased with this guide, it's not the only option for getting started. Mojang maintains their own getting started guide on the Creator Platform, which you can consider following instead.
